## Event build log

## 2026-10-10T22:59:08+05:30 — Establish Wishbound asset and game architecture

- Changed: Imported runtime-ready Grassland, Soldier, and Orc PNGs under `public/assets`; added `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ASSETS.md`, and the included Grassland CC0 notice; updated `README.md` with the project’s actual current status.
- Why: Establish a small, verified asset set and clear Phaser module boundaries before implementing the vertical slice.
- Validation: Inspected the extracted packs, confirmed the Grassland tilesheets use a 16 px grid, confirmed five parallax background layers, and checked the Soldier/Orc walk strips are 800 x 100 (eight 100 x 100 frames).
- Limitations: The free character pack contains only Soldier and Orc. The portal is not yet available locally, and Raven icons remain excluded pending an explicit recorded licence.

## Template setup — 10 October 2026

- Changed: Added the event README, rules, agent guide, change log, AI usage record, submission checklist, Git ignore rules, and pull request checklist.
- Why: Give participants a consistent starting point for event rules, basic coding patterns, documented changes, and regular commits.
- Validation: Checked local Markdown links, event detail consistency, required documents, and diff whitespace before publishing.
- Limitations: Documentation scaffolding only; no participant project, application, or working demo is included. GitHub publication and template status are verified separately after creation.
